# Slither
[Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) is a framework for static analysis of Solidity and Vyper, written in Python3,
offering several features for stability and security checks:
- Detection of vulnerable Solidity code with low false positives
- Identification of error conditions in source code
- Integration into CI and Hardhat/Foundry builds
- Built-in 'printers' for swift reporting of crucial contract information
- Provided detector API; a tool for integrating custom and tailored analyses
- Ability to analyze contracts written with Solidity >= 0.4
- Intermediate representation [SlithIR](https://github.com/trailofbits/slither/wiki/SlithIR) enables simple,
  high-precision analyses
- Integrates with Github's code scanning in CI
- Supports Vyper Smart Contracts

## Installation:
#### Prerequisite - set up solidity:
- Python 3.8+.
- [Supported compilation framework]() or Solidity compiler, it is recommended to use
  [solc-select](https://github.com/crytic/solc-select?tab=readme-ov-file) (note: for ARM processor architecture
  [Rosetta](https://github.com/crytic/solc-select?tab=readme-ov-file#oserror-errno-86-bad-cpu-type-in-executable)
  dependency will be needed)
- Installation of Slither via pip package manager is done via:  `python3 -m pip install slither-analyzer`, for
  other methods and detailed process explanation follow [how to install](https://github.com/crytic/slither?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-install)
  section

#### Example of use `solc-select`
```shell
solc-select install 0.8.25
solc-select use 0.8.25
```
#### Follow up with the desired setup.
## Working Principle:
Slither's main working principle is based on converting solidity Smart Contracts code into the
intermediate representation called SlithIR which is used under the hood
[SSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single-assignment_form) and reduced instruction set to
perform program analysis like [dataflow analysis](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/DataFlowAnalysisIntro.html)
or [taint checking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taint_checking).
General Slither architecture is shown below on the fig. 1.

According to the paper ["Slither: A Static Analysis Framework For Smart Contracts"](https://agroce.github.io/wetseb19.pdf),
we can distinguish 4 main angles, in which the tool might be used:
* **Automated vulnerability detection**: a large variety of
  Smart Contract vulnerabilities can be detected without user intervention.
* **Automated optimization detection**: Slither detects code
  optimizations that the compiler misses
* **Code understanding**: printers summarize and display
  contractsâ€™ information to aid in the study of the codebase.
* **Assisted code review**: through its API, a user can interact
  with Slither.
## Tool analysis:
Slither takes [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) structure that is generated
during the compilation process using `solc` compiler and recovering metadata from it, including analyzing inheritance graph,
[control flow graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_graph) and the list of all expressions.
The entire bytecode is transformed into Slither's own IR (Intermediate Representation) which allows to capture of more details,
useful in the next stages of static analysis.

Slither requires the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the Smart Contract for analysis. It attempts to download source code of the Smart Contract from [Etherscan](https://api.etherscan.io/api?module=contract&action=getsourcecode&address=0xb6d242f16E8878693a436a53554ec73aae3F233D) URLs, and fails if unavailable. Consequently, Slither does not function correctly with unverified Ethereum Smart Contracts. Analysis with the --etherscan-only-bytecode flag also [fails](https://github.com/crytic/slither/issues/1801#issuecomment-1484151756) for the same reason.

> **NOTE:**
> Slither is not executing any code provided by the user, the entire analysis provided by the tool is performed on the bytecode,
> therefore deployment context and environment are not taken into account, and analysis is strictly static.
## Research directions and conclusions:
### Contract may be provided to Slither in two different methods:
1) as an address of the already deployed contract: `NETWORK:0x...`, *as of April 2024, Hedera is not listed within the
   available provider list*.
> Supported networks: mainet, optim, ropsten, kovan, goerli, sepolia, tobalaba, bsc, testnet.bsc, arbi, testnet.arbi,
> poly, mumbai, avax, testnet.avax, ftm, goerli.base
2) By providing Smart Contract implementation in Solidity.

### Overview of Slither Detectors and Their Blockchain Specificity
Solidity code is not tied to a particular blockchain; it is crafted for platforms that uphold the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). 
Hence, Slither doesn't necessitate modifications or improvements for distinct chains. It hasn't integrated any rules or 
supplementary details specific to a chain, and presently, there are no chain-specific detectors in the official project repository

### Test summary:
> #### ENVIRONMENT:
> * Slither version: 0.9.6
> * Python version: 3.11.7
> * OS: GNU/Linux x86_64 6.5.0-28 Kubuntu distro

* Test contracts were performed on different Solidity versions: {0.4.11, 0.4.19, 0.8.9}.
  Running Slither on an incorrect language version can yield unexpected Python exceptions -
  some error cases are not properly handled within the Slither implementation
* Calling Internal Hedera System functions are reported by Slither as `low-level-calls` which is categorized as
  `Informational` impact type. This means that no additional actions need to be made for Slither to Hedera compatibility -
  from the tool perspective, those are just normal address calls, as the potential solution it may be beneficial to
  ensure that Slither will recognize address 0x167 as assigned to Hedera's internal system functions.
* Slither's Detectors provide API that may be used to provide custom internal Hedera checks such as:
    * ecrecover is not supported for ED25519 accounts
    * precompiles that are missing in the Hedera EVM
      example of detector implementation POC may be found [here](detectors/hedera/ecrecover_usage_local.py)
    * custom detectors can be added, following [this instruction](https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Adding-a-new-detector)
* It might be beneficial to introduce eth tools -> Hashscan compatibility layer proxy API that would enable
  transparent communication between Hashscan and Slither.
* Tests didn't generate any kind of high-impact vulnerability. The Table below depicts a detailed histogram
  of the reported issues by the Slither (for hts-precompile contracts):
