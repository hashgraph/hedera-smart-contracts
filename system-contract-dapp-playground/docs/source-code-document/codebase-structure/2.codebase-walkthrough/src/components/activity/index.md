## Codebase Walkthrough - **src/components/activity/** Folder

The **src/components/activity/** folder serves as a repository for all the UI components associated with the `/activity` route within the application.

Within this directory, you'll find the following subdirectories, each housing specific components:

- `ActivityTransactionTable/` folder: Contains the `ActivityTransactionTable` component, which functions as a table displaying all the transactions executed during the current user session.

- `ExtraOptionsButton/` folder: Encompasses the `ExtraOptionsButton` component, designed as a button that provides users with actionable options for performing operations on transactions such as deleting or exporting transactions.

- `QueryResponseModal/` folder: Hosts the `QueryResponseModal` component, which serves as a modal window used to present response data for transactions with READONLY attributes.

This organized structure ensures that UI components related to the `/activity` route are neatly categorized, enhancing code maintainability and readability.
