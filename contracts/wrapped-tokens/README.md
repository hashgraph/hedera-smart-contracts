### WHBAR

The WHBAR contract for Wrapped HBAR to help transactions that use native token payments.

*Note: Always use the `deposit()` function to wrap HBAR. HBAR sent directly to the contract (via non-contract functions e.g via `CryptoTransfer` ) will be permanently locked in the contract due to Hederaâ€™s `CryptoTransfer` mechanics.*
